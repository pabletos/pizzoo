Pizzoo is a robust Python library designed for developers who want to unlock the full potential of matrix LED displays, particularly the Pixoo64, a 64x64 pixel LED display, and extend its functionalities to various other devices. Whether you're looking to create dynamic animations, develop interactive games, or integrate unique display functionalities, Pizzoo provides you with the tools and flexibility to innovate and express your creative ideas.

## Features

* **Full Animation Creation and Control**
	With frame-by-frame programatic drawing capabilities you can craft detailed animations directly on your LED display, allowing you to visually conceptualize, iterate, and render animations seamlessly.

* **Template Rendering**
	Our built-in compiler supports an XML/HTML-like language for template processing. This facilitates the design of UIs with relative positioning, defined areas, and reusable components, helping you creating fast and reusable interfaces.

* **Flexible integration with any device**
	The Renderer class can be easily extended to support additional methods and integrate with various hardware. This ensures that Pizzoo can adapt to your specific project and hardware requirements.

* **Game Development Toolkit**
	Tap into the possibilities of micro game development with our mini game engine. Design, develop, and deploy small-scale games that can be played right on your LED devices, perfect for creating engaging interactive experiences.
