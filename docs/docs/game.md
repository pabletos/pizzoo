# Building your first game

!!! warning "**This feature and the documentation is still a work in progress, if you have any feedback or suggestions, please let us know!**"

Included with this library is also a pretty simple `Game` class that can be used to create little games that can be played on a renderer (With direct support for the Pixoo64 device).

!!! info "**Game framerate on the Pixoo64 is really low**"

    So this is just a cool feature that can be used for more static games like card games and not so much oriented to any kind of adventure or action oriented game. This, of course, can be different for any other renderer, as technical specs varies a lot.
