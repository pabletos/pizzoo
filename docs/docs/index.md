# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the Pizzoo library documentation! Pizzoo is a robust Python library designed for developers who want to unlock the full potential of matrix LED displays, particularly the Pixoo64, a 64x64 pixel LED display, and extend its functionalities to various other devices. Whether you're looking to create dynamic animations, develop interactive games, or integrate unique display functionalities, Pizzoo provides you with the tools and flexibility to innovate and express your creative ideas.

## Features

Pizzoo is equipped with a range of features that cater to both hobbyists and professional developers:

- **Full Animation Creation and Control**: Leverage our intuitive frame-by-frame drawing capabilities to craft detailed animations directly on your LED display. This feature allows you to visually conceptualize, iterate, and render animations seamlessly.

- **Game Development Toolkit**: Tap into the possibilities of micro game development with our mini game engine. Design, develop, and deploy small-scale games that can be played right on your LED devices, perfect for creating engaging interactive experiences.

- **Template Rendering**: Our built-in compiler supports an XML/HTML-like language for template processing. This facilitates the design of UIs with relative positioning, defined areas, and reusable components, making it easier to create a consistent look and feel across your applications.

- **Flexible Integration**: At the core of Pizzoo is the extensible Renderer class, which can be customized to support additional methods and integrate with various hardware. This flexibility ensures that Pizzoo can adapt to your specific project requirements, enabling control over a wide range of devices beyond the default library support.
